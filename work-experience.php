                                                        <li>Setup the first e-library by reviving 11 comatose computer systems and an abandoned printer. Cleaned up the library's store with appropriate permission, and converted it into an e-library that took only 11 people at a time. The e-library was heavily used by students and lecturers.</li>
                                                        <li>Trained lecturers, students, and library staff on the efficient use of scholarly databases, search engines, library management software, and the online public access catalogue for improved research output.  </li>
                                                        <li>Cut database subscription cost for the library by using computer folders to store and organise downloaded open access e-books. The e-books were accessed offline and used frequently by students and lecturers in times of poor Internet connection. </li>
