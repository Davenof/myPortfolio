                                                        I designed this high-fidelity prototype in August 2021, both as an academic work and as a replacement for the <a href="https://nla.ng/" target="_blank" class="text-primary">Nigerian

                                                        example, when a form’s submit button is clicked, the intricacies of the submission process are not
                                                        implemented. Also, when members log in, they are directed to the Association's forum on the website, but the complex details
                                                        that represent the functionality of the forum are not prototyped.

                                                        A significantly usable website was the aim of the prototype, hence, white was the primary and dominant background 
                                                        colour across all pages, which made elements on it visible. However, in pages and sections of pages where a dark 
                                                        background was used, light-coloured elements were used on such backgrounds to enhance visibility, and in line with 
                                                        the Gestalt's principle that light elements are outstanding on a dark background, and vice versa.  

                                                        <div class="mt-3 fw-bold">Colours</div>
                                                        Four major colours were used to enhance the design – two primary colours (red and blue), and two 
                                                        secondary colours (green and gray) – in line with the principles which emphasise that too many colours may
                                                        be beautiful, but they could be overwhelming on a page, and could reduce visual hierarchy. 
                                                        Green, yellow, and red are the colours of the Association, with green as the dominant. 
                                                        Because of its dark appearance, green was used as background color in areas holding important elements that 
                                                        needed to be visible, like the header holding the navigation menu. Gray was used either as background colour to enhance the visibility
                                                        of the relatively darker elements on it, or as border colour to reduce the overwhelming feel of the white space around an
                                                        element, which makes the bordered elements appear as a group. Red was used mainly to attract attention to specific features 
                                                        and content, and as border colour to reduce the effect of large white spaces around elements. Blue was used 
                                                        for hypertexts and forms 'Submit' buttons.

                                                        <div class="mt-3 fw-bold">Size, Scale, and Grouping</div>
                                                        Three dominant font sizes were used for the main contents across pages. All headings were same font size. Same as all subheadings 
                                                        and the main page texts. However, larger font sizes were used on some banners to attract attention to the message they are 
                                                        passing across.   
                                                        
                                                        <div class="mt-3 fw-bold">Alignment</div>
                                                        Headings were aligned to the top left corner of pages and page sections to help the user determine quickly what a page or section is all about.
                                                        This was because the Gestalt Theory postulates that elements in the upper left corner are seen first. 
                                                        Page banners and sliders were aligned top center for prominence in line with the Gestalt principle. Hence, the message 
                                                        they hold is easily communicated. Pages listed in the “About NLA” submenu have a sidebar which also was aligned to the left
                                                        of the pages as the sidebar holds important quick facts about the Association.

                                                    To boost the visibility of all important content, the prototype pages were trimmed uniformly across
                                                    board to hold only a few content, where the remainder of a long content is displayed on another page.
                                                    The standard dimension for all pages is 1440px (width) x 2000px (height), except for pages that display
                                                    an expanded accordion menu, where the height of such pages is 2400px. The accordion was used
                                                    where necessary to compress very long segmented content into one page to enhance visibility.

                                                    The accordion feature used in some pages has the plus (+) and minus (-) signs which when clicked,
                                                    expands and retracts a particular row of the accordion, respectively. The plus and minus triggers for
                                                    expansion and retraction conform with Don Norman’s ‘Feedback’ principle which states that functions should
                                                    be designed in such a way that users get a corresponding action in response to the action they performed,
                                                    as an indication that the users action caused something to happen.

                                                    <div class="mt-3 fw-bold">Constraints</div>
                                                    According to Norman, the constraints design function restricts what user interaction can take
                                                    place at a time. Hence, when the prototype’s accordion menu expands, it does not overlap with the
                                                    footer, as the feature was constrained to open within the main text area which pushes the footer further
                                                    down, rather than overlap with it. 

                                                    <div class="mt-3 fw-bold">Mapping</div>
                                                    Mapping is the relationship between control and effect, where the control to a feature closely resembles
                                                    the effect (Norman, 2013). Hence, the plus (+) and minus (-) convention was adopted for the accordion
                                                    menu to easily communicate their functions of expansion and retraction, respectively.

                                                    <div class="mt-3 fw-bold">Consistency</div>
                                                    The design and function of the header, footer, and navigation menu is consistent across pages.
                                                    Consistency has also been maintained in the font family and size of headings and texts. Likewise, the
                                                    design of the main text area of pages listed on the “About NLA” submenu is similar, while pages not
                                                    listed in the “About NLA” submenu were designed in uniform fashion, except for the homepage which
                                                    is designed differently because of the kind of content it holds. The prototype design conforms with Norman's 
                                                    'Consistency' principle which teaches that interfaces should be designed to perform similar
                                                    operations, and similar elements should be designed to perform similar tasks consistently.

                                                    <div class="mt-3 fw-bold">Affordance</div>
                                                    Form fields have placeholders which give users instant clue about what particular information a field
                                                    requires from the user. Also, a form’s submit button communicates its function quickly to the users with
                                                    the text on the button. Additionally, the previous and next slider icons represented by angle brackets
                                                    give an indication about their role, as well as the back arrow icon on the login page. Basically, affordance is 
                                                    "to give a clue" for ease of use.

                                                            it is still a native prototype.
                                                        </p>

                                                        I designed the prototype in April 2022 as part of the Digital Skills for the Workplace Web Development programme in Liverpool, England. 
                                                        The programme was funded by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education" target="_blank" class="text-primary">UK Department for Education</a>, <a href="https://www.liverpoolcityregion-ca.gov.uk/" target="_blank" class="text-primary">Liverpool City Region Combined Authority</a>,

                                                        Training was provided by <a href="https://code-academy.co.uk/" target="_blank" class="text-primary">Code</a> (Academy), UK.

                                                        General UX design guiding principles were followed in the design of this website to give users a good experience. 
                                                        However, the dominant design principle adhered to is the Shneiderman's <a href="https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/collections/shneidermans-eight-golden-rules-of-interface-design" target="_blank" class="principle fst-italic">"Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design"</a>.

                                                        The entire structure of this prototype was marked up with HTML 5.

                                                        <div class="mt-3 fw-bold">CSS 3</div>
                                                        CSS 3 was used to complement Bootstrap styles in order to avoid large-scale repitition. For example,
                                                        where a Bootstrap 5 class was to be used repeatedly across most pages and page sections to achieve the same purpose,
                                                        in order to avoid repeating the class, reduce the file size, and increase page loading time, a CSS 3 class with a global 
                                                        style is used instead. So, wherever the class is used, all the CSS-defined features/styles apply, as against writing 
                                                        and rewriting several Bootstrap classes to achieve the same purpose.
                                                        Also, CSS 3 was used to alter some Bootstrap defaults such as "<span class="fst-italic">color</span>", 
                                                        "<span class="fst-italic">margin</span>", "<span class="fst-italic">font-size</span>", "<span class="fst-italic">font-family</span>", etc, 
                                                        
                                                        <div class="mt-3 fw-bold">Boostrap 5</div>
                                                        A Bootstrap 5 theme was used for the prototype. However, the theme was tweaked beyond its defaults so that
                                                        it looked significantly different. That notwithstanding, Bootstrap 5 defaults for responsiveness were relied upon.
                                                        Also, Bootstrap 5 classes were used extensively for styling where appropriate.

                                                        JavaScript (Bootstrap 5 scripts) was used to implement the animated graphs and charts on the "Dashboard", as well as the dynamic table.
                                                        JavaScript was also used to implement the sidebar toggle feature so that users can have full or boxed view of the Dashboard content.

                                                        The extended version is partially dynamic. It is partially dynamic because only a few aspects of the "Class Login" side of the prototype is dynamic.
                                                        Other aspects of the "Class Login", as well as the entire "Remote Login" side are static. See the "Highlights" tab below.

                                                        PHP was used to develop the "Signup" and "Login" systems, and to connect the systems to the users databases created with MySQL.
                                                        PHP was used also to dynamically include into the pages, the primary and secondary "navigation bars", the "sidebar", and the footer. 
                                                        Furthermore, PHP was used to dynamically display the email address, name, and designation (teacher or instructor) of the logged-in user,
                                                        and to notify users to log in when they try to access a page that only logged in users have access to.

                                                        (e.g., during signup, joining a class, etc.) or unsuccessful. The primary and secondary navigation bars, 
                                                        as well as the footer are consistent, even during media responsiveness. Also, the colour choice and blend 
                                                        are consistent across pages. Hyperlinks are consistently blue, a fine blend of black and orange is the 
                                                        dominant appearance, and backgrounds are a combination of white and gray.

                                                        Although the website is simple and straight to the point, the fact that frequent users would like faster ways to 
                                                        get frequently performed tasks done was taken into consideration. Hence, a "Remember Password" option was included 
                                                        in the login pages so users wouldn't have to enter their login details always. A "Forgotten user ID or password?" 
                                                        option was also provided to make life easy for users when they forget a login detail. A "Home" link was made 
                                                        suffiently available before and during a login session to give users the option of trying again from home. On the 
                                                        "Class Login" page, links to the "Remote Login", "Signup", and "Home" pages were provided for easy navigation, and 
                                                        done likewise on the "Remote Login" page.  Furthermore, "Download", "Print", and "Share" options were provided as 
                                                        macros on pages with stats, so that with one click, users can download, print, or share data rather than following 
                                                        the computer convention of doing same.

                                                    The informative feedback provided above was designed to yield closure, and to give users the satisfaction of

                                                    The prototype which simulates a website was designed to be simple and straightforward so that users cannot make 
                                                    a serious error. However, for the fact that people could click something in error when they meant to click 
                                                    something else, or make other possible human errors, the Shortcuts provided above were designed to also be 
                                                    error handlers.

                                                    Although the prototype has little or no action that needs reversal, breadcrumbs were provided however in the 
                                                    "Dashboard" child pages to help users reduce the number of actions they have to take to get to a higher-level page. 
                                                    Also, the "Students Data Table" has an option in the top-left corner that allows users change the number of entries 
                                                    they would like to view per page, as well as return to the default. Similarly, the table is paginated at the 
                                                    bottom-right so that users could explore other pages, and as well reverse their action to default.

                                                    The entire prototype was designed to be very simple to explore, to give users a sense of control over the actual website. 

                                                    <div class="mt-3 fw-bold">Short-term Memory Load Reduction</div>
                                                    In order to reduce short-term memory load, a group of elements does not have more than four large elements in 
                                                    the group. Where cards were used, e.g., in the "Dashboard", not more than four cards were used in a group so 
                                                    that the user's brain wouldn't have much to process. Although the Dashboard contains data from all students' 
                                                    activities, options to view individual data group were provided in the sidebar navigation of the Dashboard.

                                                        The system was designed in way that when a user logs in while in class, the "Access Type" is green. On the other hand,
                                                        the "Access Type" is amber when they log in from a location other than class (Remote Login).

                                                        while logged in, the "Sign Up" and "Log In" options are no longer present on the homepage. When the user logs out,

                                                        the options to delete and edit the profile are available to them. However, when someone else views the profile 
                                                        (e.g., from the "Classes" page, by clicking the image or name of the class instructor), they don't see the "Delete" and 
                                                        "Edit" options. Rather, they see the options to follow or message the instructor.                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                    </div>

                                        <div class="col-xl-6">
                                            <div class="card mb-4 border-0">

                                                    The prototype was designed in a way that the profile owner can actually edit their profile (apart from their 
                                                    email address which doesn't change) and save it. However, there is no depth to the editing and saving as there 
                                                    is no database that holds the information. 

                                                    <div class="mt-3 fw-bold">Access Type Privileges</div>
                                                    When the system detects the login session is "Class Login", the options to download, print, and share dashboard 
                                                    stats/data are available to the user. Contrarily, the same options are disabled when the "Access Type" is not "Class", 
                                                    as download of students' fitness data is only allowed in class. This is for security reasons.

                                                    <div class="mt-3 fw-bold">Sidebar Menu Toggle</div>
                                                    On the "Dashboard" page, users have the option to expand or contract the page view using the hamburger icon at the top-right 
                                                    corner of the secondary navigation bar. However, when the page is not Dashboard, the toggle icon is disabled because 
                                                    other pages don't have the sidebar menu.  
                                                    
                                                    <div class="mt-3 fw-bold">Colour Convention</div>
                                                    On the Dashboard and its child pages, the colour green represents positive or impressive data. 
                                                    Blue represents something good or normal, but not as impressive as the greens. Yellow represents something that calls 
                                                    for concern, although it is not aweful. Red represents something in a bad shape and should be looked into.
